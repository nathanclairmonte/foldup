# Fold

Fold is a CLI tool to help you "fold" your codebase into a single, easily digestible Markdown file for consumption by an LLM.

## TODO

- [x] Add Taskfile for linting, testing, building, etc.
- [x] Add support for a `.foldignore` file
- [x] Facilitate estimating the number of tokens in the output file
- [ ] Faciliate glob patterns for excluding files in config or `.foldignore`
- [ ] Add `--version` flag
- [ ] Sort list of output files by size (number of lines? number of chars or tokens?)
- [ ] Exclude image files as well, or any other non-text files
- [ ] Update README with installation and usage instructions
