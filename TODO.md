## TODO

- [x] Add Taskfile for linting, testing, building, etc.
- [x] Add support for a `.foldignore` file
- [x] Facilitate estimating the number of tokens in the output file

- [ ] Add an `--only-tree` flag to only generate just the project tree and not the file contents
- [x] Faciliate glob patterns for excluding files in config or `.foldignore`
- [x] Add license
- [x] Add `--version` flag
- [ ] Package for release on PyPI: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for releasing
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Sort list of output files by size (number of lines? number of chars or tokens?)
